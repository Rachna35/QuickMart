# QuickMart
a project website based on 'Instant delivery services and earning opportunities for locals'

QuickMart is a hyperlocal instant delivery platform designed for hostel and semi-urban areas where major delivery apps like Zepto and Blinkit don’t operate. This project was built using Design Thinking principles to solve two key issues faced by students: the lack of fast delivery options and the need for flexible earning opportunities. QuickMart enables users to place orders via a simple website or WhatsApp, while student delivery partners fulfill them in real-time—making everyday essentials accessible, affordable, and fast.
